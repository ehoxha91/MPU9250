# MPU9250
Library for MPU9250 and MPU6050 

To use this library, import MPU9250.h to your code and you can use it as any other library.

Don't forget this library uses arduino library for I2C comminucation. So, if you aren't using arduino then you should change the protocol functions to read raw data of IMU, but everything else should work the same.
