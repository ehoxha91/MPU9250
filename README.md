# MPU9250
Library for MPU9250 and MPU6050 

Just copy the needed files and import them into your arduino project.

Don't forget this library uses arduino library for I2C comminucation. So, if you aren't using arduino then you should change the protocol functions to read raw data of the IMU, but everything else should work the same.
